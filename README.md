# Heat-Conduction-by-Python-Using-SPH-.
Modeling Transient Heat Transfer Using SPH and Implicit Time Integration.
Smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) is a computational method used for simulating the mechanics of continuum media, such as solid mechanics and fluid flows. 
It was developed by Gingold and Monaghan and Lucy in 1977, initially for astrophysical problems.

Here in this project I was done  heat conduction using SPH. In the zip folder, you will find the SPH code for 2 cases. 
In case 1, all the particles are set to an initial temperature of 0 and a gaussian heat source has been placed at the centre. 
In case 2, as given in the research paper, the boundary particles are at temperatures of 0 and the inside particles are at temperatures of 100 degrees. 
You can see result of this code.
